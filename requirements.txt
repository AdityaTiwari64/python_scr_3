# Minimal requirements for core functionality
# The implementation primarily uses Python standard library

# Essential packages (your code actually doesn't need external packages)
# All required modules are built into Python 3.7+:
# - ast (Abstract Syntax Tree)
# - sys (System functions)  
# - typing (Type hints)
# - dataclasses (Data classes)

# If you want to extend functionality:
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0

# For testing the implementation:
pytest>=6.2.0
