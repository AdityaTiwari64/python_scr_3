# Research Plan: Evaluating CodeLlama-7B-Python for Python Student Competence Analysis

---

## **Research Plan**

### **Approach to Identifying and Evaluating Relevant Models**

My evaluation strategy focuses on **CodeLlama-7B-Python** as the primary candidate due to its Python-specific optimization, educational accessibility, and open-source licensing. I will establish evaluation criteria encompassing three dimensions:

• **Technical accuracy** - ability to identify syntax, runtime, and logical errors\
• **Pedagogical effectiveness** - generating scaffolded hints rather than direct solutions  \
• **Practical deployment** - model size, inference speed, resource requirements\

The evaluation framework employs a **three-phase methodology**:
• **Phase 1:** Tests basic error detection and explanation capabilities using curated student code samples\
• **Phase 2:** Evaluates conceptual diagnosis by assessing the model's ability to identify and articulate deeper misconceptions (e.g., mutable default arguments, scope confusion)\
• **Phase 3:** Measures Socratic questioning capability by testing the model's generation of guiding prompts that lead students toward self-correction without revealing solutions directly\

### **Testing and Validation Methodology**

Validation employs a **mixed-methods approach** combining automated metrics with expert human evaluation. For technical accuracy, I will benchmark the model against annotated datasets of student Python code containing known error types and competency markers. For pedagogical quality assessment, I will establish a panel of experienced Python educators who will evaluate model-generated prompts using a structured rubric measuring:

• **Conceptual targeting** - accurately addressing underlying misconceptions\
• **Cognitive scaffolding** - providing support without eliminating productive struggle\
• **Inquiry orientation** - encouraging investigation rather than passive reception\
• **Clarity and accessibility** - comprehensible without additional cognitive burden\
• **Learning transfer potential** - promoting generalization beyond immediate context\

The validation includes **controlled experiments** where student responses to model-generated versus traditional prompts are compared to measure actual learning outcomes. Additionally, I will conduct scalability testing to ensure the solution can handle classroom-sized deployments while maintaining response quality and speed, with particular attention to the trade-offs between model accuracy, computational cost, and educational effectiveness in real-world educational settings.

## **Reasoning**

### **What makes a model suitable for high-level competence analysis?**

A model suitable for high-level competence analysis requires **three core capabilities** beyond basic error correction:

1. **Semantic Understanding**\
   • Ability to comprehend code intent and logic, not just syntax
   • Recognition of when syntactically correct code fails to implement intended functionality
   • Understanding of program flow and algorithmic reasoning

2. **Diagnostic Precision**\
   • Differentiating between surface mistakes (typos) and fundamental misconceptions
   • Identifying root causes: scope confusion, object model misunderstanding
   • Providing targeted feedback appropriate to each error type

3. **Pedagogical Reasoning**\
   • Generating educationally constructive responses that promote learning transfer
   • Strategic questioning that activates prior knowledge
   • Scaffolded guidance maintaining appropriate challenge levels
   • Fostering metacognitive development through reflective prompts

### **How would you test whether a model generates meaningful prompts?**

Testing prompt meaningfulness requires a **qualitative, expert-centered evaluation framework**:

#### **Evaluation Setup**\
• Establish a panel of experienced Python educators
• Provide student code containing documented conceptual errors
• Generate model prompts for systematic evaluation

#### **Multi-Dimensional Rubric Assessment**
• **Conceptual Targeting:** Does the prompt accurately address underlying misconceptions rather than surface symptoms?
• **Cognitive Scaffolding:** Does it provide appropriate support without eliminating productive struggle?
• **Inquiry Orientation:** Does it encourage active investigation rather than passive information reception?
• **Clarity and Accessibility:** Is it comprehensible without introducing additional cognitive burden?
• **Learning Transfer Potential:** Does it promote generalization beyond the immediate problem context?

#### **Validation Methods**
• **Expert rating sessions** with structured evaluation protocols
• **Controlled studies** measuring actual student learning outcomes
• **Comparative analysis** between model-generated versus human-created prompts
• **Longitudinal assessment** of learning progression and retention

### **What trade-offs might exist between accuracy, interpretability, and cost?**

Significant trade-offs exist across these dimensions with **direct educational implications**:

#### **Accuracy vs. Cost**
• **Large Models (34B+ parameters):**
  - Superior code comprehension and nuanced error analysis
  - Substantial computational resources and operational costs
  - Potential latency issues disrupting interactive learning

• **Smaller Models (7B parameters):**
  - Faster response times and lower operational overhead
  - Deployable on standard educational infrastructure
  - May miss subtle conceptual errors or generate less sophisticated responses

#### **Interpretability vs. Accuracy**
• **High-Accuracy Models:**
  - Superior performance on complex reasoning tasks
  - Function as "black boxes" with opaque decision-making
  - Difficult to identify pedagogical biases or validate reasoning

• **Interpretable Models:**\
  - Clear insight into decision-making processes
  - Easier to audit and fine-tune educational approaches
  - May sacrifice analytical depth needed for sophisticated competence analysis

#### **Cost-Latency Trade-off**
• **Educational Context Requirements:**\
  - Immediate feedback is crucial for student engagement and learning momentum
  - Budget constraints in educational institutions
  - Need for scalable solutions across diverse classroom sizes

• **Strategic Considerations:**
  - Accept reduced analytical sophistication for pedagogical responsiveness
  - Balance comprehensive analysis with financial sustainability
  - Optimize for real-time interaction over exhaustive evaluation
